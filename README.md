## Overview
Streams is a [Squire](http://www.squireapp.com) feature that lets the user watch content available outside of their hard drive. This means a stream is an ordered collection of items that can be watched in Squire. Each stream is encapsulated in an ```stm``` file. ```stm``` files are added to the Squire Helper which then extracts, orders and organizes the contents for the stream so they can be enjoyed from any available Squire client. The format for these files is open and this document explains how to properly create them.

## What's this? 
This repository contains 2 streams which make use of the EZTV (torrent tracker) API. The first EZTV-Mythbusters loads Mythbusters episodes to be displayed in Squire and the second will (in the future) load all shows from EZTV and display them in Squire. Presently there are performance issues loading all shows from EZTV. 


## Installation
Download or clone this repository and double click on the .stm file (template.stm on this case). The stream will be added automatically to Squire Helper. After a few minutes, the streamâ€™s content will be available on 'Shows' section on Squire.app. (**NB: At present 'Shows' streams are not available in the present version of Squire**)
